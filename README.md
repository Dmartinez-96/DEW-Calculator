# DEW4SLHA
This program computes the naturalness measures $\Delta_{EW}$ (DEW) and produces an ordered list of contributions to DEW from the one-loop and partial two-loop Higgs minimization conditions using the effective potential method and a user-provided input SLHA file from the user's choice of spectrum generator. For versions later than v1.3, the program also computes the naturalness measures $\Delta_{HS}$ and $\Delta_{BG}$ for the user-input SLHA file.
